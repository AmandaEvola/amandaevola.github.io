<b>
  
 This is my own personal blog talking about controversial topics such as certifications/certificates versus a degree, the use of experience in Information Technology, and even my own experiences in the IT industry. 

 I will also be talking about my favorite tech, different YouTube personalities in the IT/Computer Science world, and FAANG companies.

 I will also be showcasing my own achievements and what led me to get to them with my own perspective.

 Lastly, I will be talking about different startups/companies and the financial/business side of IT. 

 I appreciate you reading my blog and I hope you enjoy the ride.</b>

 <b> The comptia A+ is a well known entry level IT certification usually for entry level IT jobs, 
  
  a quick Indeed search shows that there are over 300 jobs just for my area alone.
  
  
  
  
  
  The Google IT Support Professional Certificate however, differs. 
  
  In a quick Indeed search for jobs with the Google IT Support Professional Certificate show only 17 jobs. 
  
  I don't know about you, but to me that isn't a whole lot.
