 This is my own personal blog talking about controversial topics such as certifications/certificates versus a degree, the use of experience in Information Technology, and even my own experiences in the IT industry. 

 I will also be talking about my favorite tech, different YouTube personalities in the IT/Computer Science world, and FAANG companies.

 I will also be showcasing my own achievements and what led me to get to them with my own perspective.

 Lastly, I will be talking about different startups/companies and the financial/business side of IT. 

 I appreciate you reading my blog and I hope you enjoy the ride.
 
<h1>Is the CompTIA A+ REALLY worth it?</h1>

<br>The CompTIA A+ is a well known entry level IT certification usually for entry level IT jobs,</br>
 
 
   
  
  a quick Indeed search shows that there are over 300 jobs just for my area alone.
  
  
  The Google IT Support Professional Certificate however, differs. 
  
  In a quick Indeed search for jobs with the Google IT Support Professional Certificate shows only 17 jobs. 
  
  I don't know about you, but to me that isn't a whole lot.
  
  
 Although what it lacks in jobs it does give you a decent fundamental knowledge of IT. 
  
  
I myself am in the process of obtaining the Google IT Support Professional Certificate with only 2 courses left, so far from being basically a beginner I can now confidently be able to understand basic PowerShell and Linux commands with additional knowledge of binary/subnetting, software/operating systems, and general security/infrastructure concepts.
  
The labs in my opinion from QwikLabs are pretty useful for the Google IT Support Professional Certificate (unless there is an issue with your account, I learned that the hard way by resetting my account.) 
  
The staff from QwikLabs also reply to your emails very quickly for resetting the labs as well, in my experience.


From my own private investigation on Reddit the general consensus is that the CompTIA A+ beats the Google IT Support Professional Certificate in 2 ways.



JOBS, AND RECOGNITION.


The CompTIA A+ will most likely always be more recognized than the Google IT Support Professional Certificate mainly due to the fact that the CompTIA A+ has been around over almost 30 years launching in 1993 compared to the Google IT Support Professional Certificate only being around for only 5 years launching in 2017.



The other obvious reason is due to the jobs the CompTIA A+ brings, the A+ is basically the gold standard for someone seeking an entry level IT support job (with/without a degree, or experience.) Several people on multiple social media platforms (LinkedIN, Youtube, Reddit, etc.) have expressed their progression in their career goals from the comptia A+.

On the other hand, while there are a LOT of cons to the Google IT Support Professional Certificate, there are a lot of pros as well. 

The Google IT Support Professional Certificate is useful in 3 ways: KNOWLEDGE, PRICE, AND THE NAME GOOGLE. 


From my own experience the Google IT Support Professional Certificate is the real deal for IT knowledge for a beginner, the labs are very in-depth and really test your knowledge (also worth adding that you need to at least get 80% to pass a lab I believe.)

The name Google also never looks bad on a resume, especially since it's a FAANG company.

The price is also very good compared to the CompTIA A+ from a Google search, the price is $438 for the CompTIA A+ compared to the Google IT Support Professional Certificate being around half the price at $234 for 6 months (you could also get the Google IT Support Professional Certificate free with financial aid.) 


One argument for the price comparison once again would be that not only CompTIA A+ is double the price, it's double the value (although I have gotten interviews with the Google IT Support Professional Certificate I am yet to see offers.)

Overall, I would say that they both hold their own value but the CompTIA A+ is a much better value all-around. 


The personal advice I have would be that if you are seeking an entry level job in IT the best barrier to entry would be to pursue the Google IT Support Professional Certificate in preparation for the CompTIA A+ certification so you can obtain both which shows determination, dedication, and education. 

One neat fact is that if you choose to obtain both the CompTIA A+ and Google IT Support Professional Certificate you can earn a dual LinkedIN badge which looks great to employers.
