						I will also be talking about my favorite tech, different YouTube personalities in the IT/Computer Science world, and FAANG

						Next, I will be showcasing my own achievements and what led me to get to them from my own perspective.

					<div class="infohead"><b>Is the CompTIA A+ REALLY worth it?</b></div>
					<div class="infobody"><p>
			
  
						
						<br>The CompTIA A+ is a well known entry level IT certification usually for entry level IT jobs,
                                                    a quick Indeed search shows that there are over 300 jobs just for my area alone.</br>
  
  
 
						
						
							     
							     <br>The Google IT Support Professional Certificate however, differs.</br>
  
 
    
							     
							     
						<br>In a quick Indeed search for jobs with the Google IT Support Professional Certificate shows only 17 jobs.</br> 
  
  
    
						
							     
							     <br>I don't know about you, but to me that isn't a whole lot.</br>
  
  
 
   
						
							     
						 <br>Although what it lacks in jobs it does give you a decent fundamental knowledge of IT.</br> 
  
  

   
						
							     
							
							     
				 <br>I myself am in the process of obtaining the Google IT Support Professional Certificate with only 2 courses left, so 
				 far from being basically a beginner I can now confidently be able to understand basic PowerShell and Linux commands 
			 with additional knowledge of binary/subnetting, software/operating systems, and general security/infrastructure concepts.</b>
  

     
						
		               
				
			    <br>The labs in my opinion from Qwiklabs are pretty useful for the Google IT Support Professional Certificate (unless 
					there is an issue with your account, I learned that the hard way by resetting my account.)</b> 
  

      
						
							     
			       <br>The staff from Qwiklabs also reply to your emails very quickly for resetting the labs as well, in my experience.</br>



     
						
				<br>From my own private investigation on Reddit the general consensus is that the CompTIA A+ beats the Google IT Support 
							     Professional Certificate in 2 ways.</br>




						
     
						
						                    
							     
							     <br>JOBS, AND RECOGNITION.</br>



      
	
					  <br>The CompTIA A+ will most likely always be more recognized than the Google IT Support Professional Certificate mainly 
					due to the fact that the CompTIA A+ has been around over almost 30 years launching in 1993 compared to the Google IT 
						Support Professional Certificate only being around for only 5 years launching in 2017.</br>




      
							  
					<br>The other obvious reason is due to the jobs the CompTIA A+ brings, the A+ is basically the gold standard for someone 
					seeking an entry level IT support job (with/without a degree, or experience.) Several people on multiple social 
					media platforms (LinkedIN, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) have expressed their progression in their career goals from the 
							                              CompTIA A+.</br>



     
						
							                <br>Just look at this post right here:</br> 
 
						
							     
							     
					  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/cmjqff/i_got_a_job_a_cert_only/">CompTIA A+ Job Post</a>



						
    
				
																		
			         <br>On the other hand, while there are a LOT of cons to the Google IT Support Professional Certificate, there are a lot of pros as well.</br> 


    
				
																		
																		
																		
						              
								           
								         <br>The Google IT Support 								
							                  Professional Certificate is 
							                  useful in 3 ways: KNOWLEDGE, 
							                   PRICE, AND THE NAME GOOGLE.</br> 



      
       
							              <br>From my own experience the Google 
								            IT Support Professional 
							                Certificate is the real deal for 
							                 IT knowledge for a beginner, the 
							                 labs are very in-depth and really 
                                                 test your knowledge (also worth adding that you need to at least get 80% to pass a lab I believe.)</br>


   
						
				
																		
				      <br>The name Google also never looks bad on a resume, especially since it's a FAANG company.</br>


     
		
	
																		
																		
						                <br>The price is also very good 
							      compared to the CompTIA A+ from a 
								Google search, the price is $438 
							         for the CompTIA A+ compared to 
								      the Google IT Support
								Professional Certificate being 
								around half the price at $234 for 
								6 months (you could also get the 
								Google IT Support Professional 
								Certificate free with financial 
									     aid.)</br> 



    
								 <br>One argument for the price 
								comparison once again would be 
								that not only CompTIA A+ is 
								double the price, it's double the 
								value (although I have gotten 
								interviews with the 
								Google IT Support Professional 
								Certificate I am yet to see 
									offers.)</br>


     
			
																		
			
				 <br>Overall, I would say that they both hold their own value but the CompTIA A+ is a much better value all-around.</br>



     
							 <br>The personal advice I have would 
							be that if you are seeking an 
							entry level job in IT the best 
							barrier to entry would be to 
							pursue the Google IT Support 
						        Professional Certificate in 
							preparation for the CompTIA A+ 
							certification so you can obtain 
						        both which shows determination, 
							dedication, and education.</br>


     

						       <br>One neat fact is that if you 
						    choose to obtain both the CompTIA 
						      A+ and Google IT Support 
						    Professional Certificate you can 
						    earn a dual LinkedIN badge which 
						      looks great to employers.</br>
